              <p className="text-lg">
                Chamois leather is a versatile and eco-friendly material, made
                from Indian goat leather. Its soft and natural beige hue comes
                from fish oil tanning, ensuring a gentle touch on various
                surfaces. With remarkable water absorbency, it's perfect for
                drying cars, and its biodegradable nature makes it easy to wring
                out, dry, and store. Moreover, chamois leather showcases its
                polishing prowess by flawlessly buffing glass, plastics,
                jewelry, and diamonds, leaving a scratch-free shine. Embrace the
                elegance of chamois leather for all your cleaning and polishing
                needs.

                <li>
                  Before use wash thoroughly thrice with lukewarm water with the
                  mild / car wash soap, mainly to remove any excess oil left out
                  in the leather. Afterwards rinse in normal water.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Clean in mild soap water to remove the dirt and wring out.
                  Then dry the cloth in the shade by completely spreading it
                  out.

                <li>
                  It tends to turn stiff after drying. So just rub the cloth on
                  itself to restore its softness, then fold it and store it in a
                  dry place away from chemicals, heat and sunlight.
                </li>
                <li>

                  container, while it is wet
